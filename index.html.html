<p>  Call of Duty is a first-person shooter video game franchise published by Activision. Starting out in 2003, it first focused on games set 
in World War II. Over time, the series has seen games set in the midst of the Cold War, futuristic worlds, and outer space. The games were first developed by Infinity Ward, then also by Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games. Several spin-off and handheld games were made by other developers. The most recent title, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, was released on October 28, 2022.
The series originally focused on the World War II setting, with Infinity Ward developing
 the first (2003) and second (2005) titles in the series and Treyarch developing the third (2006). Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (2007) introduced a new, modern setting, and proved to be the breakthrough title for the series, creating the Modern Warfare sub-series. The game's legacy also influenced the creation of a remastered version, released in 2016. Two other entries, Modern Warfare 2 (2009) and Modern Warfare 3 (2011), were made. The sub-series received a reboot
 with Modern Warfare in 2019, with a sequel released in 2022. Infinity Ward have also developed two games outside of the Modern Warfare sub-series, Ghosts (2013) and Infinite Warfare (2016). Treyarch made one last World War II-based game, World at War (2008), before releasing Black Ops (2010) and subsequently creating the Black Ops sub-series. Four other entries, Black Ops II (2012), III (2015), 4 (2018), and Cold War (2020) were made, the latter in conjunctio
n with Raven Software. Sledgehammer Games, who were co-developers for Modern Warfare 3, have also developed three titles, Advanced Warfa (2014), WWII (2017), and Vanguard (2021).

Gameplay
Free Fire is played in third person perspective. As in other shooting games, the player can move their character using a joystick and shoot and throw items with the fire button. In-game characters can jump, crawl, and lie down. When on the battlefield, players can use a grenade called a "Gloo Wall" as a cover to avoid damage
n the Battle Royale mode, a maximum of 52 players land on a random island without weapons. All of them have to survive by killing each other using weapons and accessories that are found in the buildings. Players have the option to play this mode solo, or in a team of 2 or 4 players. If players play this mode ranked, it will have an impact on their rank. Whereas, Classic mode is just for fun and practice. There are six Battle Royale maps in Free Fire they are Bermuda, Bermuda Remastered, Kalahari, Purgatory, Alpine, and NeXTerra
Clash Squad is a 4 VS 4 mode. In this mode, players use in-game money to buy weapons and other items from a shop during preparation time, and then fight against the opponent team. As a best-of-7 mode, games last from four to seven rounds. A round is won when all 4 players of one team are eliminated, either by the other team or by environmental damage. As of 2022 the game uses the same maps as the Battle Royale mode. Clash Squad can be played both as Ranked or Classic.[16][17][18]

Lone Wolf
"Lone Wolf" is either a 1 vs 1 or "duo" (2 vs 2) version of Clash Squad mode with more complex rules. Each side will have chances to choose equipment to be used in next 2 rounds. Rounds are played best-of-5. If both sides have won 4 rounds each, then final round will begin with both sides free to choose weapon of their choice. All players acquire basic items like vest and helmet by default from the start of the round. This mode takes place in its own map called "Iron Dome".[19]

Craftland
raftland let the players create their own Free Fire maps using an in-game builder. With the Craftland feature, players can create, share and play with the maps they created.

It supports script editing for advanced customization which lets the creators have more freedom to work with their ideas.

Character System
Free Fire features a character system of 50+ characters. Each character has a unique skill which can be active or passive.

<p>
PUBG: Battlegrounds (previously known as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) is a battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Studios, a subsidiary of Krafton. The game, which was inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, is based on previous mods created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island where they scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill other players while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into an ever tightening space to force encounters. The last surviving player (or team) wins the round. It is the first game in the PUBG Universe series.

PUBG: Battlegrounds, having sold over 75 million copies on personal computers and game consoles as of the end of 2021, is the best-selling video game on PC and Xbox One, and the fifth best-selling video game of all time. Even more successful is PUBG Mobile's global version, which has accumulated more than 1 billion downloads and grossed over $8.42 billion on mobile devices, making it the fourth highest-grossing mobile game. With the combined revenue of PC and console games equaling $4.65 billion, PUBG: Battlegrounds has a total revenue of $13.07 billion as of May 2022, making it one of the highest-grossing video games of all time. The main game has been free-to-play since January 12 2022.
